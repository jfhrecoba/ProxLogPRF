Insider Trading - Dealing in shares with the advantage of inside information.
The owners of shares in a public company are all supposed to be equal - so if
one of them knows that the company is about to go broke before the others and
sells his shares while their price is still good, that is unfair.  In many
countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., it is also illegal.  However, it
is very difficult to prove that an investor is buying or selling shares on the
basis of inside information.

conflicting or opposing policies.

A relevant document will cite an instance in which the U.S. federal government

conflicting policies, NOT a reversal of policy.  Examples of two-faced policy
of interest include: expending funds in the campaign against tobacco use while
subsidizing the U.S. tobacco industry and the marketing of U.S. tobacco
products abroad, allowing imports of produce treated with pesticide which is
banned in the U.S., disapproving the sale of deficient infant formula in the

To be relevant, document must contain international crude oil production and

daily output by any member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) or the larger non-OPEC producers (e.g. U.S., USSR, Mexico,

of its members; and, prices in at least one of the so-called "benchmark" crude
oil markets (specifically, West Texas Intermediate, North Sea Brent, Rotterdam
crude oil spot market, and crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange).  Documents referencing OPEC and its members likely will report or
speculate about political and diplomatic moves related to the "official" OPEC

equipment in the international arms market.


<smry> Summary:

Document will identify a proposed or recently concluded official sale
of military equipment between countries in the international arms
market.


<narr> Narrative:

To be relevant, document will identify a proposed or recently concluded sale
of military equipment, to include weapons platforms, munitions, spares,
ancilliary equipment, technology, and services.  The equipment and quantities
must be identified, and recent should be defined as within the previous 12
months, but the price and conditions of sale are optional information.  Any
international sale, including transfers between NATO members or equipment
being provided under military aid programs, is relevant.  However, political
discussions of international military equipment sales, such as debate of the
Iran-Contra Affair, discussion of the UN embargo against South Africa, or
Congressional expressions of hostility against equipment sales to Arab states,
unless linked to a specific transaction, are not relevant.

A relevant document will provide information which aids description of the 
design and technology to be used in the anti-missile defense system advocated
by the Reagan administration, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), also 
known as "star wars."  Any reported changes to original design, or any

Document will report those proposed or enacted changes to U.S. federal, 
state, or local welfare laws and regulations which are propounded as reforms.


<narr> Narrative:

A relevant document will reveal attempts by any U.S. jurisdiction to change 
the legal or regulatory context of existing welfare programs, or to add new 
programs, which are described or labeled as a reform.  For the purposes of 
this topic, a welfare program must revolve around a transfer payment for 
which the recipient had not previously made contributions, other than 
through general tax payments. Examples include General Assistance, Aid for 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), public housing, Medicaid, income 
subsidies (rent and fuel subsidies, earned income tax credit, food stamps, 
etc.), child care programs (day care subsidies, nutrition programs, Head 
Start, etc.), and vocational training programs.  NOT relevant are those 
programs which could be viewed as the payment of insurance benefits to those 
who had previously made contributions (either directly or indirectly through 
a family member or employer), such as Medicare, Social Security survivor's 
benefits, and unemployment insurance.  Also NOT relevant are those documents
which deal solely with the financing or administration of existing programs.

<def> Definition(s):

Welfare program: although the above distinction between a "pure" transfer 
payment program and a putative insurance program is debatable, the 
distinction is made to focus the data search on those programs which are 
clearly in the welfare category, as opposed to the wide variety of social 
programs supported by U.S. government entities.

Document will report on non-traditional (innovative) applications of
space satellite technology.


<narr> Narrative:

A relevant document will discuss more recent or emerging applications of 
space satellite technology.  NOT relevant are such "traditional" or early 
satellite age usages as INTELSAT transmission of voice and data 
communications for telephone companies or program feeds for established 
television networks.  Also NOT relevant are such established uses of 
satellites as military communications, earth mineral resource mapping, and 
support of weather forecasting.  A few examples of newer applications are 
the building of private satellite networks for transfer of business data, 
facsimile transmission of newspapers to be printed in multiple locations, 
and direct broadcasting of TV signals.  The underlying purpose of this topic 
is to collect information on recent or emerging trends in the application of

relative to potential generic drug substitutions: the name of a generic drug,
the brand name (or chemical term) of the drug for which it is an equivalent, 
the manufacturer or distributor of the generic, and the medical condition(s) 
treated by both the generic and the brand name drug.  Reports which contain 
multiple generic equivalencies are clearly relevant, since the purpose of
