<def> Definition(s):

Insider Trading - Dealing in shares with the advantage of inside information.
The owners of shares in a public company are all supposed to be equal - so if
one of them knows that the company is about to go broke before the others and
sells his shares while their price is still good, that is unfair.  In many
countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., it is also illegal.  However, it
is very difficult to prove that an investor is buying or selling shares on the
basis of inside information.

To be relevant, document must contain international crude oil production and
price data in at least two out of the three following categories: reported
daily output by any member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) or the larger non-OPEC producers (e.g. U.S., USSR, Mexico,
Norway, and Great Britain); the official production quota set by OPEC for any
of its members; and, prices in at least one of the so-called "benchmark" crude
oil markets (specifically, West Texas Intermediate, North Sea Brent, Rotterdam
crude oil spot market, and crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange).  Documents referencing OPEC and its members likely will report or
speculate about political and diplomatic moves related to the "official" OPEC
price, but such information by itself is not directly relevant.  The best

To be relevant, a document must give specific data on totals, additions,

Document will report on laser research related, or potentially related, to 
the U.S.'s Strategic Defense Initiative.


<smry> Summary:

Document will report on laser research related, or potentially related, to 
the U.S.'s Strategic Defense Initiative.


<narr> Narrative:

A relevant document will provide information on laser research which is 
either explicitly linked to the U.S.'s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, 
also known as "star wars") or which has potential applicability to the 
development of SDI laser technology.  Potentially relevant research could be 
referred to as research into directed energy weapons, or high energy lasers, 
or, more generally, referred to as military laser research.  A relevant 
document could take many forms -- award of contract, report of research 
results, or abstract of a professional paper on lasers.  However, a document 
clearly focused on use of low-power lasers in consumer products, surgical 
instruments, or industrial cutting tools is NOT relevant.

<smry> Summary:

Document will report those proposed or enacted changes to U.S. federal, 
state, or local welfare laws and regulations which are propounded as reforms.


<narr> Narrative:

A relevant document will reveal attempts by any U.S. jurisdiction to change 
the legal or regulatory context of existing welfare programs, or to add new 
programs, which are described or labeled as a reform.  For the purposes of 
this topic, a welfare program must revolve around a transfer payment for 
which the recipient had not previously made contributions, other than 
through general tax payments. Examples include General Assistance, Aid for 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), public housing, Medicaid, income 
subsidies (rent and fuel subsidies, earned income tax credit, food stamps, 
etc.), child care programs (day care subsidies, nutrition programs, Head 
Start, etc.), and vocational training programs.  NOT relevant are those 
programs which could be viewed as the payment of insurance benefits to those 
who had previously made contributions (either directly or indirectly through 
a family member or employer), such as Medicare, Social Security survivor's 
benefits, and unemployment insurance.  Also NOT relevant are those documents
which deal solely with the financing or administration of existing programs.

<def> Definition(s):

Welfare program: although the above distinction between a "pure" transfer 
payment program and a putative insurance program is debatable, the 
distinction is made to focus the data search on those programs which are 
clearly in the welfare category, as opposed to the wide variety of social 
programs supported by U.S. government entities.

<title>  Anti-smoking Actions by Government


<desc> Description:

Document will describe actions by public authorities to limit the human use of
tobacco.


<smry> Summary:

Document will describe actions by public authorities to limit the human use of
tobacco.


<narr> Narrative:

A relevant document will provide at least one example of actions proposed 
or taken by public authorities anywhere in the world to limit or discourage 
the human use of tobacco.  Limits may take any regulatory or legal form 
appropriate to that jurisdiction, to include sales controls, limits on 
advertisement, mandatory warning labels, and establishment of no-smoking 
zones.  Court findings against tobacco companies (if any), as well as 
publicly financed anti-smoking campaigns and education programs, are to be 
considered as relevant forms of discouragement.  In addition, public funding 
of medical research into tobacco use is relevant information.  However, 
private anti-smoking initiatives, such as creating no-smoking areas, are NOT 
relevant unless traceable in origin to government action.  Also NOT relevant 
are contradictory, pro-tobacco government actions, such as tobacco price 
support programs and export encouragements.
